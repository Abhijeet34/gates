# gates

The checks that stand between a commit and a public push: a gitleaks pre-push hook and its rules, a scanner that refuses machine-detectable origin marks, the machine-wide git hooks that run both, and five reusable GitHub Actions workflows that re-check the same things in CI.

## What is here

| Path | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `.githooks/pre-push`, `.gitleaks.toml` | The repository-local secret gate and the canonical rules. Callers carry byte copies, distributed by `.ci/gitleaks/sync.sh`. |
| `system-maintenance/git-hooks/` | The machine-wide hooks deployed to `~/.git-hooks` by `install.sh`, including `watermark-scan.py`. Its `README.md` owns the design and the measurements. |
| `.github/workflows/shared-*.yml` | Reusable workflows: `secret-scan`, `watermark-scan`, `dependency-advisories`, `guard-generated-files`, `no-mistakes-required`. |
| `.ci/` | The contract test for each workflow's step body, the gitleaks rule and allowlist suites, and `check.sh`, which runs all of them. |

## Calling a workflow

```yaml
jobs:
  secret-scan:
    uses: Abhijeet34/gates/.github/workflows/shared-secret-scan.yml@main
```

Callers reference `@main`.
A caller cannot move a commit pin on its own, which was measured on 2026-09-17 in a private caller.
Its `GITHUB_TOKEN` was refused on every write that touches `.github/workflows/`: `git push` and the contents API answered `refusing to allow a GitHub App to create or update workflow ... without workflows permission`, and the git data API answered `Resource not accessible by integration`.
That token also could not open a pull request, because the repository's Actions setting forbids it (`GitHub Actions is not permitted to create or approve pull requests`).
It can dispatch the caller's own workflows, and a dispatched run puts its `checks` result on the commit it ran on, so the write is the only missing piece.
A pinned `uses:` therefore needs a writer that already holds workflow write, such as Dependabot's `github-actions` updater, whose pull requests do receive the caller's checks.
A reusable workflow runs in the caller's checkout with the caller's token, so a caller grants whatever the workflow reads: `shared-dependency-advisories.yml` needs `vulnerability-alerts: read`, and `shared-no-mistakes-required.yml` needs `pull-requests: read`.
`shared-secret-scan.yml` pins the sha256 of `.gitleaks.toml` and `.githooks/pre-push`, so a caller whose synced copy has drifted fails until `.ci/gitleaks/sync.sh <clone>` is re-run.
`shared-watermark-scan.yml` checks out this repository at the workflow's own commit for its scanner, so a caller carries no copy of it.

## Using the hooks on a machine

```bash
system-maintenance/git-hooks/install.sh deploy   # this checkout -> ~/.git-hooks
system-maintenance/git-hooks/install.sh check    # report drift, exit 1 if any
.ci/gitleaks/sync.sh --check <clone>...          # drift in each clone's synced copies and core.hooksPath
```

Deploying is one way on purpose.
`~/.git-hooks` runs on every commit and push, so nothing copies live content back into this repository.

## Checks

```bash
.ci/check.sh                  # shell, python and secrets
.ci/check.sh shell            # one suite
```

`shell` includes `.ci/test-workflow-policy.sh`, which fails on `pull_request_target`, `workflow_run`, `issue_comment` or `self-hosted` anywhere in a workflow file, and on any secret other than `GITHUB_TOKEN`, because anyone can call these workflows once the repository is public.
`secrets` needs `gitleaks`, `exiftool`, `qpdf`, `ffmpeg` and ImageMagick, and refuses rather than skipping when one is missing.
A gate that skipped what it could not run would report a pass over something it never measured.
